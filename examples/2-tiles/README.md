# Tiles

Sprites are moving graphics. Tiles, or background tiles, are non-moving static graphics. In this example, we will create a background composed of tiles, and we will draw sprites on top of the background.

## Instructions

```bash
# build example
nesasm tiles.asm

# run example
Nestopia tiles.nes

# build and run example
./build-and-run.sh
```
