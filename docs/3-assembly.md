# Assembly

Computers speak in binary or 1's and 0's. Humans can, but it is not convenient. Instead, it is easier for humans to use a machine-like language that can be easily translated (or assembled) into binary. For the NES, that language is 6502 assembly language.

## What Can the NES Do?

The NES, like all any computer, is a dumb machine. Its capabilities can be grossly simplified into basic arithmetic and bit shuffling. While this may sound primitive, it is really all you need to create a NES game.
