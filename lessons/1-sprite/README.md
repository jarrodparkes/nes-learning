# Lesson 1

In this lesson, we will properly initialize the NES and draw a Mario sprite.

## Assumptions

Before beginning, you should be familiar with the following topics:

- number systems (primarily binary and hexadecimal)
- bits, nibbles, and bytes
- read-only memory (ROM) versus random-access memory (RAM)
- assembly-language programming

## Run the Example Code

```bash
nesasm sprite.asm
```
