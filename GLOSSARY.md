# Glossary

You will find tons of acronyms and terms when developing for the NES. Below, are some of the most common ones. NesDev also maintains a helpful [glossary](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Glossary).

## 0-9

- [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502)
  - the MOS Technology 6502 processor which powers many electronics like the NES; the assembly language used to program the 6502 family of processors

## A

- [APU (Audio Processing Unit)](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU)
  - a special piece of hardware in the NES responsible for generating sound
- ASM (Assembly)
  - human-readable code or coding languages that can be assembled into binary instructions that can control a CPU

## B

- Binary
  - the base-2 number system; counting with 0's and 1's

## C

- CHR (Character)
  - another word for a graphical tile
- CIC (Checking Integrated Circuit)
  - a special piece of hardware in the NES used to prevent pirated, non-licensed games from running on the system; "the lockout chip"
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
  - the central piece of hardware in a computer; the mechanism which controls a computer's operation
- Cycle
  - the "heartbeat" of a CPU; all CPU operations (ex: LDA, STX) take a certain number of cycles to complete; a CPU's clock speed is a measure of how many cycles a CPU can perform per second

## D

- Dendy
  - a Russian clone of the [NES]
- DMA (Direct Memory Access)
  - a special hardware mechanism on the NES that allows for the quick transfer of graphical data to OAM
- DMC (Delta Modulation Channel)
  - a unique channel on the APU that plays samples (pre-recorded sounds) like percussion or voice sounds

## E

## F

- Famicom (Family Computer)
  - the Japanese name for the NES

## G

## H

- Hexadecimal
  - the base-16 number system; uses 0-9 and A-F to represent all 16 distinct symbols

## I

- I/O (Input/Output)
  - "things that can be taken in" (ex: user pressing a button) and "things that can be produced" (ex: a sprite rendered on screen)
- Interrupt
  - a signal that can preempt a CPU's processing; a CPU signal that needs to be processed
- IRQ (Interrupt Request)
  - a signal on the NES CPU; used interchangeably with the word interrupt

## J

## K

## L

## M

## N

- [NES (Nintendo Entertainment System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System)
  - an 8-bit video game console created by Nintendo in the early to mid 80's
- [NMI (Non Maskable Interrupt)](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/NMI)
  - a signal that causes a processor to stop so that it can be handled

## O

- [OAM (Object Attribute Memory)](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_OAM)
  - internal memory inside of the NES PPU that contains a display list of 64 sprites

## P

- [PPU (Picture Processing Unit)](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU)
  - a special piece of hardware in the NES responsible for rending graphics to a screen

## Q

## R

- RAM (Random Access Memory)
  - memory that can be read or written-to while a program is running
- ROM (Read Only Memory)
  - memory that can be read, but not written-to while a programming is running; the digital representation of game which can played, or "read", by an emulator

## S

- Sprite
  - a graphic that has a movable position; on the NES, sprites are 8x8 pixels; multiple sprites can be combined together to create larger moving graphics

## T

## U

## V

- [VBLANK (Vertical Blank)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blank_interrupt)
  - an interrupt that is fired when a (raster) display is finished drawing a full screen, or frame, of graphics; the interval between video frames
- VRAM (Video RAM)
  - RAM whose primary function is for representing visual elements like sprites or colors

## W

## X

## Y

## Z
